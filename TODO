- [x] Create a more expressive configuration syntax (YAML? TOML? Python/Lua DSL?)
- [x] Emit outputs to `/output`
- [x] Config structural validation (JSON Schema)
- [x] Config semantic validation (unique names)
- [ ] Fuzzing tests that ensure matching is not biased
- [ ] Improve docs
- [ ] Perf
- [ ] Static analysis of configuration that detects unsolvable situations before processing (is this possible...?)
- [ ] Post-solve validation before validating output (every person has a match, nobody is repeated)
